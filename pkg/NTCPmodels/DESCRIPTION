Description: Fits the Lyman and the Logit NTCP models, with:
    (1) the   equivalent uniform dose (EUD) 
    (2) the equivalent dose at 2Gy    (EQD2) and the EUD. 
        There is the possibility of extending the NTCP model with other 
        clinical/  genetic variables. The package contains special 
        functions for dose volume histograms (DVH),  differential  
        DVH and  diagnostic plots for wrong DVH data.
